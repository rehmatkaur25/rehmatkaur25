 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a B.Tech CSE (AIML) student at VIT Bhopal University, with a passion for coding and problem-solving.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently strengthening my knowledge in Java and C++, building a strong foundation for future projects.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to data structures, algorithms, or machine learning.
